# arbnormalism
arbnormal information systems management repo project for decentralizing freelancers and contractors across rapidly evolving domains in all industries.

End Goal: open source and self hostable infrastructure for small businesses that provides them with everything they need to scale and simplify their operations remotely and securely.

as a business owner who spends more time in the field than the office it is essential to be able to access key resources remotely. even then it is not always easy for my people, and that has led me to seek other solutions. while there are fairly affordable solutions out their the issue i run into is that they are extremely limited and lack the power or flexibility i am seeking.....but wait can't you pay more money for all that. sure can, and that is the point. remove the throw money at it and add more crap on top is something that any busy worker is attracted to. open source software is great, but it is not always simple or easy for people who are not super tech savvy. i have explored countless options and im sure there are countless more. i realize that i will more than likely continue to have to pay for some things as such is life, but i know that i am not the only one with the desire to make business more accessible, applicable, and actionable. that being said here is a brief breakdown of my current thoughts and path.

Front End: mobile application and website/web app
Reasons and Requirements: cross platform functionality is non negotiable so i keep leaning towards flutter. the mobile app is essential for field/service workers and management. websites are critical for an online presence and searchability by clients.

Backend: n8n for automation and connecting services, etc. pangolin for secure access of resources including n8n. nextcloud all in one for files, docs, and powerful cloud office capabilities.

Database: supabase
